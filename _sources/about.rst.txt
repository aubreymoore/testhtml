Technical Notes About grant-tracker
===================================

I developed grant-tracker to help me manage my grants. It is built using the **Sphinx** documentation system and content was written using the **ReStructuredText** markup language. 

Getting Started
---------------

I used **sphinx-quickstart** to created a skeleton project on my local Linux machine.::

   mkdir grant-tracker
   cd grant-tracker
   sphinx-quickstart
   make html

At this point, html files are written to **grant-tracker/_build/html** and
can be viewed by opening **index.html** in a web browser.

Building the Site
-----------------

The site was built simply by adding reStructuredText files (\*.rst) to the **grant-tracker** directory using a text editor.

I found `techwritingmatters.com <https://techwritingmatters.com>`_ to be very useful for learning **Sphinx** and **ReStructuredText**.
